# Bloom Filters

## TL;DR

A Bloom filter answers set-membership queries with one-sided error: "definitely not present" or "probably present," never a false negative. It does this in roughly 10 bits per element at a 1% false-positive rate — against an information-theoretic minimum of ~6.6 bits — which is why it sits in front of nearly every disk read in an LSM-tree storage engine. But the textbook picture ("bit array plus k hashes") hides the parts that matter in production: the false-positive rate is a *budget* that degrades quadratically-ish as the filter overfills (a filter sized for 1M keys holding 5M is ~83% false positives, not 5%); the k probes are k random DRAM cache misses unless you use a blocked layout; uniform bits-per-key across LSM levels is provably the wrong allocation (Monkey); and for immutable data, Bloom is no longer the best filter — Ribbon and binary fuse filters get 20–30% closer to the entropy bound. This chapter derives the math honestly, walks the LSM read path where filters earn their keep, and covers the modern filter zoo and the ways filters fail silently.

## Why the Filter Exists: Negative Lookups Are the Expensive Ones

A B-tree answers "key not present" cheaply: one root-to-leaf descent, mostly cached, and the leaf proves absence. An LSM tree ([LSM Trees](./02-lsm-trees.md)) cannot — the key could be in *any* run, so absence can only be proven by checking every candidate SSTable.

Count the candidates in a typical leveled LSM:

```
Leveled compaction, fanout 10, 7 levels:
  L0: up to 4 overlapping files   → 4 candidate runs
  L1–L6: one sorted run each      → 6 candidate runs
  Total: ~10 runs may contain any given key

Point lookup for a MISSING key, no filters:
  10 runs × (index block + data block read) ≈ 10–20 block reads
  At ~100μs per cached-miss NVMe read: 1–2ms to learn "not found"

Same lookup with a 1% FPR filter per run:
  Expected disk reads = 10 runs × 0.01 = 0.1 reads
  → 100–200× reduction in read amplification for negative lookups
```

And negative lookups dominate more workloads than intuition suggests: deduplication ("have I seen this event ID?"), insert-if-absent and uniqueness checks, cache-fill probes, write paths that must verify a key does *not* exist before creating it. In these workloads the common case is the miss, and the filter converts the common case from "read every level" to "read nothing."

This is the framing to keep: **a Bloom filter is a prepaid answer for the question "is it worth going to disk?"** Everything else — sizing, hashing, layout — is about how much that prepaid answer costs and how often it lies.

## The Structure and Its One-Sided Error

A Bloom filter is a bit array of `m` bits and `k` hash functions. Insert sets `k` bits; query checks `k` bits.

```
Insert "hello":                    Query "world":
  h₁("hello") = 3                    h₁("world") = 5 → bit 5 is 0 ✗
  h₂("hello") = 7                    → "definitely not present"
  h₃("hello") = 12                   (stop at first zero bit)
  set bits 3, 7, 12
                                   Query "hello":
┌─────────────────────────────┐      all of bits 3, 7, 12 are 1
│ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 │      → "probably present"
└─────────────────────────────┘
        ↑       ↑         ↑
        3       7         12
```

The asymmetry of the error is structural, not incidental:

- **No false negatives**: bits are only ever set, never cleared. If an element was inserted, its bits are 1 forever, so a query for it can never see a 0. (This is also why standard Bloom filters cannot support deletion — clearing a bit might clear evidence of *another* element that hashed to the same position, manufacturing a false negative.)
- **False positives**: a never-inserted element can find all its `k` bits already set by the union of other elements' insertions. The filter says "probably present," the disk read happens, and finds nothing. This is wasted work, not wrong answers — provided the surrounding system treats "probably" as a hint, not an authority (see [Failure Modes](#failure-modes)).

---

## The Math, Derived Honestly

### False-positive probability

After inserting `n` elements with `k` hashes into `m` bits, the probability a particular bit is still 0:

```
P(bit = 0) = (1 - 1/m)^(kn) ≈ e^(-kn/m)
```

A false positive requires all `k` probed bits to be 1:

```
p ≈ (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k
```

Two honest caveats the textbooks skip. First, this treats bit occupancies as independent, which they aren't; the exact rate (Bose et al., 2008) is slightly *higher* than the formula, though the gap is negligible for filters of realistic size (m in the millions). Second, the formula assumes the k hash functions are truly uniform and independent — real filters approximate this (see [Hashing](#hashing-where-implementations-actually-go-wrong)), and a bad approximation shows up as a real FPR above the theoretical one.

### Optimal k, and what "optimal" looks like

Minimizing `p` over `k` for fixed `m/n`:

```
k* = (m/n) × ln 2  ≈ 0.693 × bits-per-key

At the optimum:
  - exactly half the bits are set (load factor 1/2 — maximum entropy per bit)
  - p = 2^(-k*) = 0.6185^(m/n)
```

Inverting: to hit a target FPR `p`, you need

```
m/n = log₂(1/p) / ln 2 = 1.44 × log₂(1/p) bits per key

p = 1%    → 1.44 × 6.64 ≈  9.6 bits/key, k = 7
p = 0.1%  → 1.44 × 9.97 ≈ 14.4 bits/key, k = 10
p = 0.01% → 1.44 × 13.3 ≈ 19.2 bits/key, k = 13
```

Each extra ~4.8 bits/key buys one decimal order of magnitude of FPR. Note what this formula does *not* contain: the size of the elements. A Bloom filter for 64-byte keys and one for 4KB documents cost the same 9.6 bits per element at 1% — the filter stores evidence of hashes, not data.

### The 44% tax, and why post-Bloom filters exist

Information theory sets a floor: any structure answering membership with false-positive rate `p` needs at least `log₂(1/p)` bits per element. Bloom's `1.44 × log₂(1/p)` is therefore **44% above optimal** — the price of a structure so simple it was designed in 1970 and needs nothing but a bit array. The modern filters covered below (cuckoo, ribbon, xor/binary-fuse) exist precisely to claw back that 44%, trading away either mutability or build speed:

```
Bits per key at ~1% FPR (log₂(1/p) = 6.64 → theoretical floor 6.64 bits):

  Standard Bloom       9.6 bits   (1.44× floor)   dynamic inserts
  Blocked Bloom       ~10.5 bits  (1.6× floor)    dynamic, 1 cache miss
  Cuckoo filter       ~10.1 bits  (1.5× floor)    dynamic + deletion
  Ribbon filter       ~7.0 bits   (1.05–1.1×)     static, slow build
  Binary fuse filter  ~7.5 bits   (1.13×)         static, fast build
```

### The overfill curve: FPR degrades brutally, not gracefully

The most operationally important consequence of the math: FPR is set by the *actual* `n`, not the planned one. Take a filter sized for 1M keys at 1% (m = 9.59M bits, k = 7) and keep inserting:

```
actual n     kn/m     fraction of bits set     actual FPR
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.0M (as planned)  0.73        52%                 1.0%
1.5M               1.09        66%                 5.8%
2.0M               1.46        77%                16%
3.0M               2.19        89%                44%
5.0M               3.65        97%                83%
```

At 2× overfill the filter is 16× worse than configured; at 5× it approves 83% of garbage — you're paying the memory *and* the disk reads. The failure is silent: nothing errors, latency just drifts up as "definitely not" quietly becomes "go check disk." Two structural defenses: size for 1.5–2× expected growth, and prefer architectures where filters are per-immutable-artifact (one filter per SSTable, sized at flush time from the exact key count — which is why LSM engines never hit this in steady state) over one long-lived global filter that grows past its design point.

---

## Hashing: Where Implementations Actually Go Wrong

### Double hashing: k hashes for the price of two

Computing 7 independent high-quality hashes per key is wasteful. The standard trick (Kirsch & Mitzenmacher, 2006) derives all `k` probes from two base hashes:

```
h_i(x) = h₁(x) + i × h₂(x)   (mod m),  for i = 0..k-1
```

and provably preserves the asymptotic FPR. Two implementation traps:

- **h₂ = 0 collapse**: if `h₂(x) ≡ 0 (mod m)`, all k probes hit the same bit and that key's effective k is 1. Force `h₂` odd (with power-of-two m) or add a quadratic term `+ i²`.
- **In practice, one 64-bit hash is enough**: split it into two 32-bit halves for h₁ and h₂. One xxHash/Murmur3 evaluation per key, total.

### Choosing the hash

```
Good:  xxHash (fastest), MurmurHash3 (ubiquitous), CityHash/FarmHash
Bad:   MD5/SHA-256 — cryptographic strength buys nothing here, costs 10–20× cycles
       Language-default hashCode() — weak avalanche, correlated outputs,
         and often deliberately randomized per-process (breaks serialized filters!)
       h(x) mod m with structured keys — clustering
```

The last parenthetical is a real bug class: serialize a filter built with a per-process-seeded hash (Python's `hash()`, Java's default `String.hashCode` is stable but many others aren't), load it in another process, and every query probes the wrong bits — the filter returns "definitely not" for keys it contains. **A persisted filter must pin the hash function, its seed, and the bit-index derivation as part of its serialization format.**

### 32-bit hashes stop working before you expect

With a 32-bit hash, bit indices repeat once `m` approaches 2³². But the damage starts earlier: RocksDB's legacy block-based filter derived probes from a single 32-bit hash, and above a few million keys per filter the collision structure put a *floor* under the FPR — adding bits per key beyond ~14 barely improved the real FPR even as the formula promised 0.1%. The modern full/blocked filter implementations moved to 64-bit hashing specifically to fix this. If a filter will ever hold >1M keys, use 64-bit hashes.

### Adversarial inputs

A Bloom filter with a public, unkeyed hash is an oracle: an attacker who can query it (or just knows the implementation) can compute keys whose probes land on already-set bits, manufacturing unlimited false positives — every one a disk read, i.e., a cheap request-amplification attack on exactly the path the filter was supposed to protect. Where inputs are attacker-controlled (URL dedup on a crawler, per-user rate-limit filters, spam-seen filters), use a keyed hash (SipHash) with a per-deployment secret, exactly as hash tables did after the 2011 hash-flooding attacks.

## The Memory Hierarchy: Blocked Bloom Filters

The textbook cost model says a Bloom query is O(k) "operations." The real cost model is cache misses. A standard filter's k probes are k independent random positions across a filter that is megabytes to gigabytes — each probe is a DRAM cache miss:

```
Standard bloom, k = 7, filter >> L3 cache:
  Negative query (probe until first 0): ~2 probes average → ~2 misses
  Positive/false-positive query:         all 7 probes     → ~7 misses
  At ~100ns per DRAM miss: 200–700ns per query

For comparison: the entire rest of a memtable lookup can be ~100–200ns.
The "free" in-memory check can dominate the in-memory path.
```

The **blocked Bloom filter** (Putze, Sanders & Singler, 2007) fixes this: the first hash selects one 64-byte cache-line-sized block; all k bits are set/probed *within that line*.

```
Query = exactly 1 cache miss, regardless of k.
Within the line, probing 7 bits is a handful of register ops —
and with SIMD, all probes resolve in a couple of instructions.

The price: keys are no longer spread evenly. Some blocks get
overloaded (Poisson variance across blocks), raising FPR.
Cost ≈ 0.5–1 extra bits/key to hit the same FPR as standard bloom.
```

This is not an exotic variant; it is what production engines actually deploy. RocksDB's `format_version=5` filter (available since RocksDB 6.6) is a blocked, SIMD-friendly "fast local bloom" — the flat ~duplicated-probe layout was chosen because one cache miss per query beat 30% space savings in every read-heavy benchmark. When you see "bloom filter" in a modern storage engine, assume blocked.

---

## Inside the LSM Read Path

This is where the filter earns its memory. The mechanics, using RocksDB's vocabulary (Cassandra and HBase differ in knobs, not structure):

### Where filters live and when they're checked

```
Point lookup Get(key):
  1. memtable        — optional memtable bloom (prefix-based) skips probing
  2. immutable memtables
  3. L0 files, newest first — each: check filter block → maybe read data
  4. L1..Lmax        — binary search file boundaries, one candidate file
                       per level: check filter block → maybe read data

Filter blocks are stored per-SSTable (in the table's metadata),
fetched through the block cache like any other block, and — if
cache_index_and_filter_blocks=true — subject to eviction like any
other block. For very large SSTables, partitioned filters split the
filter into a two-level structure so only the needed partition loads.
```

Two consequences worth internalizing. First, the *aggregate* false-positive cost of a lookup is the **sum of per-run FPRs** — 10 runs at 1% each means ~10% of missing-key lookups still touch disk somewhere. Second, a filter block that has been evicted from block cache must be read from disk *before* it can save you a disk read; under memory pressure filters can invert into pure overhead (see Failure Modes).

### Whole-key vs. prefix filters — and why range scans get nothing

A Bloom filter can only answer questions about exact hashed values. A range scan `[a, b)` asks about a continuum — no finite set of exact-match probes covers it, so **standard bloom filters are useless for range queries** (Cassandra lets you set `bloom_filter_fp_chance = 1.0` to disable them on scan-only tables for exactly this reason).

The partial exception: **prefix bloom filters**. Define a prefix extractor (say, the first 8 bytes = user ID), build the filter over prefixes, and iterator seeks *within one prefix* ("all events for user X") can consult the filter. RocksDB exposes this as `prefix_extractor` plus a memtable bloom (`memtable_prefix_bloom_size_ratio`); MyRocks leans on it heavily for index-prefix scans. The trade: iterators must promise not to cross prefix boundaries (`prefix_same_as_start`), or results are silently wrong — a filter skip is only sound if the query truly stays inside the filtered domain. For true range filtering, newer structures exist (SuRF, Rosetta, range-partitioned fence pointers) but none is yet a default.

### Monkey: uniform bits-per-key is the wrong allocation

Every engine's default — "10 bits/key for every SSTable" — is provably suboptimal. The insight (Dayan, Athanassoulis & Idreos, *Monkey*, SIGMOD 2017): lookup cost is the **sum of FPRs across runs**, while memory cost of achieving FPR `p` on a run of `n` keys is `∝ n·ln(1/p)`. Minimizing total expected disk reads under a fixed memory budget yields a skewed allocation:

```
With fanout 10, the last level holds ~90% of all keys.
Uniform 10 bits/key spends ~90% of filter memory on that one level.

Monkey's optimal allocation: give SMALLER (upper) levels exponentially
LOWER FPRs — they're cheap to filter aggressively because they hold
few keys — and let the largest level run at a higher FPR.

Result: same total memory, sum-of-FPRs (expected wasted reads for a
missing key) shrinks; Monkey reports the same lookup latency with
~2× less filter memory, or up to ~2× lower lookup cost at equal memory.
```

The general principle transfers beyond LSM trees: when one filter guards many tiers of different sizes and probe frequencies, allocate false-positive budget where a bit of memory buys the most avoided work — never uniformly.

---

## Beyond Bloom: The Modern Filter Zoo

### Counting Bloom filter — deletion, at 4× the price

Replace each bit with a small counter (typically 4 bits): insert increments, delete decrements, query checks all counters > 0. It works, but: 4× the memory, counters can saturate at 15 (after which a decrement would risk false negatives, so saturated counters must stay stuck — a slow FPR leak), and in practice a cuckoo filter dominates it on every axis. Counting blooms survive mostly in older network gear and papers.

### Cuckoo filter — deletion done right

The cuckoo filter (Fan, Andersen, Kaminsky & Mitzenmacher, 2014) stores small **fingerprints** (hash fragments, e.g. 8–12 bits) in a 4-way bucketed hash table using partial-key cuckoo hashing:

```
Each key has two candidate buckets:
  b₁ = hash(x)
  b₂ = b₁ XOR hash(fingerprint(x))     ← computable from b₁ + fingerprint
                                          alone, enabling eviction without x

Insert: place fingerprint in b₁ or b₂; if both full, evict a resident
        fingerprint to ITS alternate bucket, repeat (cuckoo hashing).
Query:  check both buckets for the fingerprint — exactly 2 cache misses.
Delete: remove one matching fingerprint copy. Sound, with one caveat:
        inserting the same key twice then deleting once leaves it present;
        deleting a never-inserted key can evict a colliding victim.
        Deletion is only safe if inserts/deletes are balanced by protocol.

Space: bits/key ≈ (log₂(1/p) + 3) / α,  α ≈ 0.95 at 4-way buckets
  p = 1%  → (6.64 + 3)/0.95 ≈ 10.1 bits/key   (≈ bloom)
  p = 0.1% → (9.97 + 3)/0.95 ≈ 13.6 bits/key  (beats bloom's 14.4)
```

Rule of thumb: below ~3% target FPR, cuckoo is at least as compact as Bloom *and* gives you deletion and 2-cache-miss queries. Its weaknesses: inserts can fail outright near full load (must size with headroom and handle failure), and insert cost spikes as load approaches the maximum.

### Quotient filter — merge- and resize-friendly

Stores `fingerprint = quotient‖remainder`: the quotient addresses a slot, the remainder is stored in it, collisions resolve by linear probing with three metadata bits per slot to reconstruct runs. Everything sits in contiguous memory (cache-friendly), supports deletion, can be **resized without rehashing the original keys** (fingerprints carry enough information), and two filters **merge like a sorted-list merge** — attractive for LSM compaction. Costs ~10–25% more space than Bloom and the implementation is genuinely fiddly; used more in research systems (e.g., counting quotient filters in genomics) than mainstream engines.

### Ribbon filter — RocksDB's static space-saver

For an SSTable, the key set is frozen at build time — a *static* filter can exploit that. The Ribbon filter (RocksDB ≥ 6.15, `NewRibbonFilterPolicy`) treats "key i's probes XOR to its expected value" as a system of linear equations over GF(2) and solves it at construction:

```
  ~30% less space than blocked bloom at equal FPR (~1.05–1.1× the
   entropy floor), same query speed, but 3–4× slower to BUILD.

RocksDB's guidance: use ribbon for lower levels (built rarely, by
background compaction, hold most keys → memory savings dominate) and
bloom for L0/high levels (built on every flush → build speed dominates).
That per-level policy split is Monkey-style thinking applied to filter
*type*, not just filter *budget*.
```

### Xor and binary fuse filters — the static state of the art

Same static regime as ribbon, different construction (hypergraph peeling): each key maps to 3 positions whose stored values XOR to the key's fingerprint. Xor filters (Graf & Lemire, 2020) achieve `1.23 × log₂(1/p)` bits/key; **binary fuse filters** (2022) tighten this to ~1.13× with near-linear build time — for 8-bit fingerprints, ~9 bits/key at p ≈ 0.4%, where Bloom would need ~11.5 bits — about 20% smaller. No inserts, no deletes: build once from the complete key list. Ideal for shipped artifacts — compiled block lists, CDN "does this object exist at origin" maps, malware signature sets — anywhere the set is versioned and replaced wholesale rather than mutated.

### Choosing

| Filter | Mutability | Space @ ~1% | Query cost | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blocked Bloom | insert-only | ~10.5 bits/key | 1 cache miss | Default for dynamic sets; L0/flush-path SSTable filters |
| Standard Bloom | insert-only | 9.6 bits/key | up to k misses | Only when simplicity beats latency (small filters that fit in cache) |
| Cuckoo | insert + delete | ~10.1 bits/key | 2 cache misses | Need deletion (caches, membership with churn); FPR ≤ 3% |
| Quotient | insert + delete + merge + resize | ~11–12 bits/key | 1 locality-friendly probe run | Need merging (compaction pipelines) or in-place growth |
| Ribbon | static | ~7 bits/key | ~1 cache miss | Immutable, build-time tolerant: deep LSM levels |
| Binary fuse / xor | static | ~7.5 bits/key | 3 misses (fuse: ~1–2) | Immutable, build-speed sensitive: shipped/versioned sets |

---

## Bloom Filters Beyond Storage Engines

The same "prepaid negative answer" pattern recurs anywhere a cheap check can veto an expensive operation:

**Distributed joins and query engines.** In a hash join where the build side is small and the probe side is a huge scan, engines build a Bloom filter over the build-side join keys and push it *down into the probe-side scan* (Spark's runtime filters, Snowflake/BigQuery semi-join reduction, Parquet row-group skipping). Probe rows that fail the filter never leave the scan operator — often eliminating >90% of the shuffled/scanned data. Same idea across the network: ship the filter, not the table, as a compact semi-join.

**CDN caching: the one-hit-wonder problem.** Akamai measured that ~74% of requested URLs are requested exactly once in a multi-day window (Maggs & Sitaraman, 2015). Caching an object on first request means most disk writes are for objects never read again. Fix: a Bloom filter of recently-seen URLs; cache only on the *second* request (filter hit). This "bloom filter as admission policy" roughly halved disk writes and improved hit rates — the filter isn't guarding reads at all, it's guarding *writes*.

**Bitcoin SPV — a cautionary tale (BIP-37 → BIP-158).** Light clients once sent a Bloom filter of their addresses to full nodes, which returned matching transactions; false positives were *supposed* to provide plausible-deniability privacy. It failed: across multiple filters and sessions, the intersection of "maybe" sets de-anonymizes the wallet almost completely, and serving the filtered scans enabled cheap DoS. The replacement (BIP-158) inverts the direction — the *server* publishes a compact per-block filter (a Golomb-coded set, ~same job as a Bloom filter but optimally compressed for one-shot transfer) and the client downloads whole blocks that match locally, revealing nothing. Lesson: a probabilistic filter leaks its contents under repeated observation; it is a performance structure, not a privacy mechanism.

**Stream dedup with rotating filters.** "Exactly-once-ish" event pipelines ([Delivery Guarantees](../05-messaging/04-delivery-guarantees.md)) often need "have I seen this event ID in the last hour?" A single filter would overfill (see the overfill curve above); the standard pattern is N time-bucketed filters (e.g., 6 × 10-minute filters), querying all, inserting into the newest, and dropping the oldest wholesale — deletion by retirement, never by mutation.

**Others in the same shape:** web-crawl frontier dedup (billions of URLs, false positive = a page unnecessarily skipped — tolerable); Squid's cache digests (peers exchange Bloom filters of their cache contents to route requests); [secondary-index scatter-gather pruning](../02-distributed-databases/06-secondary-indexes.md) (query only partitions whose filter says "maybe").

---

## Failure Modes

**Silent overfill.** Covered above, but it's the #1 real-world failure: no error, no log line, just FPR drifting from 1% toward 80% as `n` outgrows the design point. Detection requires *measuring* the effective FPR: `false positives / (false positives + true negatives)`, where a false positive = filter said maybe, disk said no. RocksDB exposes exactly this as `rocksdb.bloom.filter.full.positive` vs `.full.true.positive`; Cassandra as `BloomFilterFalseRatio`. Alert when measured FPR exceeds ~2× configured.

**Filter blocks evicted under memory pressure.** In RocksDB with `cache_index_and_filter_blocks=true`, filter blocks compete with data blocks for cache. Under pressure, the cache evicts the filter, and the next lookup must read the filter *from disk* before it can (maybe) save a data-block read — negative lookups get slower than having no filter, intermittently, in exactly the overloaded moments that matter. Mitigations: `pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache`, `cache_index_and_filter_blocks_with_high_priority`, or budget filters outside the block cache and watch the `filter block read` tickers.

**Merging or serialization mismatch → false negatives.** Two filters can be merged by OR-ing bit arrays *only* if `m`, `k`, hash function, and seed are all identical; a mismatch produces a structure that confidently returns wrong "definitely not" answers — the one error class Bloom filters are never supposed to make. The same failure arrives via serialization: loading a filter into a runtime whose hash seed differs (per-process randomized hashes, endianness, a library upgrade that changed bit-index derivation). Version the filter format, embed the hash ID and seed, and refuse to load on mismatch.

**Treating "maybe" as "yes."** A username-availability check backed only by a filter will reject ~p% of *available* names (false positive → "taken") — an availability bug that ships silently because tests rarely hit a colliding name. The filter must always be a fast path in front of an authoritative check, never the authority. The dual failure: using a counting/cuckoo filter's deletion against unbalanced protocol traffic (delete-without-insert), which manufactures false negatives and *does* corrupt correctness.

**Hot false positive.** One popular missing key that happens to be a false positive turns into a 100%-of-the-time disk-read hotspot (the filter re-lies on every single query — probes are deterministic). If a "missing key" is hot enough to matter, layer a small negative cache (exact, e.g. a tiny LRU of confirmed-absent keys) behind the filter.

**Weak or misused hashing.** Correlated probe bits (bad hash, `h₂=0` degeneracy, 32-bit hash on a large filter) put an invisible floor under FPR regardless of bits/key; adversarial inputs against an unkeyed hash turn the filter into an amplification vector. Both covered in the hashing section — both show up in production as "we doubled bits per key and the FPR didn't move."

## Decision Framework

| Situation | Do this |
|---|---|
| LSM/SSTable point-lookup filter, default | Blocked bloom ~10 bits/key (RocksDB `format_version≥5`); ribbon for bottom levels if memory-bound |
| Read path is mostly *positive* lookups | Shrink or skip the filter — it only pays on misses; measure `useful / queries` first |
| Table accessed only by range scan | Disable the filter (`bloom_filter_fp_chance = 1.0`); consider prefix bloom only if scans are prefix-bounded |
| Need deletion with churn | Cuckoo filter with ≥5% load headroom; ensure protocol never deletes non-inserted keys |
| Immutable, versioned set shipped to many nodes | Binary fuse (fast build) or ribbon (max compactness); rebuild per version |
| Streaming dedup over a time window | Rotating bucketed blooms; retire whole filters, never delete |
| Set will grow unboundedly / unknown n | Per-artifact filters sized at seal time (LSM-style), or scalable bloom (chained filters with tightening p); never one global filter |
| Attacker-influenced keys | Keyed hash (SipHash) with per-deployment secret |
| Filter memory across many tiers | Monkey-style skew: lowest FPR where runs are small and probed often, not uniform bits/key |
| Guarding writes, not reads (admission) | Bloom of recently-seen keys; act on second occurrence (one-hit-wonder pattern) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **The filter prepays the answer to "is disk worth it?"** — its value is proportional to your *negative*-lookup rate; on positive-heavy workloads it's pure overhead.
2. **Sizing is 1.44 × log₂(1/p) bits/key** — 9.6 bits for 1%, +4.8 bits per extra decimal digit of FPR, independent of element size.
3. **FPR degrades brutally with overfill** — 2× over design n ⇒ ~16× the configured FPR; measure effective FPR in production, don't trust the config.
4. **Count cache misses, not hash ops** — blocked bloom (1 miss) is the production default; standard bloom's k scattered probes can dominate in-memory latency.
5. **Bloom is 44% above the entropy floor** — for static sets (SSTables, shipped artifacts) ribbon and binary fuse filters buy that back.
6. **Filters can't see ranges** — range scans get nothing; prefix blooms help only for prefix-bounded iteration.
7. **Never OR-merge or deserialize across mismatched m/k/hash/seed** — that's how a filter learns to produce false negatives, the one lie it must never tell.
8. **Allocate FPR budget unevenly** (Monkey): spend bits where runs are small and probed often; let the biggest tier run looser.
9. **Probabilistic ≠ private** — repeated observation of a filter reconstructs its contents (BIP-37); it's a performance structure, not an information barrier.
